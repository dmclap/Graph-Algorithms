This the actual source for the project, and probably the only thing that
should have been added.  The algorithm implementations are in GraphAlgs,
the tests are in GraphAlgsTests, and the rest are data structures that were
built for representing and solving these problems.  There are really only two 
data structures, Graphs and Heaps, but in each case, we have one where the size
must be known in advance, and one where it can be any size.  Then, there's
also a class/interface above that to dictate what methods need to be 
implemented.
